# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

```{r}
# Inspecting Data set
yrbss %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```

> There are significantly high number of missing values under every variable. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
yrbss %>% 
  
#Summarizing summary statistics for 'weight'
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_weight = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            std_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
            max_weight = max(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
            min_weight = min(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
            count = n(), 
            SE = std_weight/sqrt(count))

#Inspecting 'weight' 
yrbss %>% 
  select(weight) %>% 
  skimr::skim() 

#Plotting Density plot 
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Density of Weight", x = "Weight", y = "Count")

#Plotting Histogram 
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Density of Weight", x = "Weight", y = "Count")

```
> From the two plots, we can infer that the distribution of 'weight' is right skewed. Comparing the mean with the median, we can observe that the mean is higher than the median, which indicates a right-skewed distribution. There are 1004 missing observations in the 'weight' variable. 

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.


```{r}
#Plotting visualizations to glimpse a general relationship between weight and physical activity

#Plot 1
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x = weight , y = physically_active_7d, na.rm = TRUE)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Weight Vs Physical Activity", x = "Weight", y = "Physical Activity")
  

yrbss1 <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(physically_active_7d == c(0:7))

#Plot 2
ggplot(yrbss1, aes(x = as.factor(physically_active_7d) , y = weight, na.rm = TRUE)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Weight Vs Physical Activity", x = "Physical Activity", y = "Weight")

```

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}
#Creating new variable based on condition 
physical_activity <- yrbss %>% 
  
  #Removing NA values
  filter(!is.na(physically_active_7d)) %>% 
  
  #Stating conditions for new variable and adding column
  mutate(physical_3plus = case_when(
          physically_active_7d >= 3 ~"yes", 
          physically_active_7d < 3 ~"no"),
          physical_3plus = factor(physical_3plus, levels = c("yes","no")))

#Calculating the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days using count()
physical_activity %>% 
  count(physical_3plus) %>% 
  mutate(proportions = n/sum(n))
```


Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

```{r}
#Calculating the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days using group_by()
physical_activity %>% 
  
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  
  #Calculating 95% CIs
  mutate(proportions = n/sum(n),
         se = sqrt(proportions*(1-proportions)/n),
         lower = proportions - 1.96*se,  
         upper = proportions + 1.96*se)

```

> The count() function gives the same output as the group_by()....summarise().
 
  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
physical_activity %>% 
  
  #Plotting boxplot
  ggplot(aes(x=physical_3plus, y=weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = " Weight vs Exercises/week",
       x = "Exercises/week",
       y = "Weight")

favstats(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = physical_activity)
```

> The boxplots do not offer much of a relationship between amount of exercises/week and weight. 


## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

# 95% CIs
physical_activity %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))%>% 
  mutate(se = sd(mean_weight, na.rm = TRUE)/sqrt(n),
         lower = mean_weight - 1.96*se,
         upper = mean_weight + 1.96*se)

#Performing hypothesis test
mosaic::t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = physical_activity)

```


> As we can see, the confidence intervals do not overlap. The confidence intervals for difference in weights pertaining to exercise/week does not contain zero. Therefore, there is a statsitical significant difference in the weight of the 2 groups. 


There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r, t_test_using_R}
#Given code also performed above for comparison
mosaic::t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = physical_activity)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- physical_activity %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

obs_diff
```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- physical_activity %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

null_dist

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Null distribution of weight ~ exercise/week")
```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}
#Constructing 95% CIs for the 2 directors
formula_ci <- movies %>% 
  
  #Filtering data set to relevant values 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) %>%

  group_by(director) %>% 
  
  #Calculating summary statistics and upper and lower CI
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            count = n(),
            margin_of_error = qt(0.975, count-1)*sd(rating)/sqrt(count),
            rating_lower = mean_rating - margin_of_error,
            rating_upper = mean_rating + margin_of_error)

#Plotting required plot
ggplot(formula_ci,aes(x = mean_rating, y = reorder(director, desc(director)), colour = director)) +

```


# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)


omega %>% 
  #Grouping by gender
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  
  #Calculating summary statistics and CIs
  summarise(n=n(), 
            mean=mean(salary), 
            sd=sd(salary),
            t_critical=qt(0.975, n-1),
           se=sd/sqrt(n), 
            margin_error=se*t_critical, 
            lower_ci=mean-margin_error, 
            upper_ci=mean+margin_error)
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

> There is wide difference in the 2 CIs of female and male indicating a significant difference in the salaries by gender. The lower bound of the male CI is significantly higher than the upper bound of the female CI for instance. 

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}

#Using infer package
observed_statistic <- omega %>%
  
  #Choosing the 2 variables
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  
  #Statistic: Difference in means
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))


null_dist_2_sample <- omega %>%
  
  #Choosing the 2 variables
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  
  #Setting Null hypothesis = independent
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
 #Statistic: Difference in means
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))


null_dist_2_sample %>%
  #Plotting graph with p-value
  visualize() + 
  shade_p_value(observed_statistic,
                direction = "two-sided") +

  labs(x = "Difference in Salary by gender",
       y = "Count",
       subtitle = "Difference in means in salary by gender")

#Calculating p-value
p_value_2_sample <- null_dist_2_sample %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_statistic,
              direction = "two-sided")

p_value_2_sample

#Performing hypothesis test
t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

> With p-value < 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say with a confidence level of 95% that there exists a significant differece between the salaries of male and female execs. 

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

```{r}
#Using infer package
observed_statistic_exp <- omega %>%
  
  #Choosing the 2 variables
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  
  #Statistic: Difference in means
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))


null_dist_2_sample_exp <-  omega %>%
  
  #Choosing the 2 variables
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  
  #Setting Null hypothesis = independent
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  #Statistic: Difference in means
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))


null_dist_2_sample_exp %>%
    #Plotting graph with p-value
     visualize() + 
      shade_p_value(observed_statistic_exp,
                direction = "two-sided") +
  labs(x = "Difference in Experience by gender",
       y = "Count",
       subtitle = "Difference in means in expereince by gender")


#Calculating p-value
p_value_2_sample_exp <- null_dist_2_sample_exp %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_statistic_exp,
              direction = "two-sided")
p_value_2_sample_exp

#Performing hypothesis test
t.test(experience~gender, omega)
```

> With p-value < 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say with a confidence level of 95% that there exists a significant differece between the experience of male and female execs requiring us to further research while developing relationship with salary. 


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
#Plotting a scatter plot for salary vs experience
ggplot(data=omega, aes(x=experience, y=salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

> There appears a high positve correlation between salary and experience. Meaning, salary and experience are somewhat directly proportional. To conclude that mean salary is higher for male with respect to gender can be wrong as males have higher mean experience than female. 





# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r,yield_curve1,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
yield_curve_1<-yield_curve%>%
  group_by(duration)%>%
  mutate(durationf=factor(duration,levels=c("3-Month Treasury Bill","6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Bill","2-Year Treasury Bill","3-Year Treasury Bill","5-Year Treasury Bill","7-Year Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Bill","20-Year Treasury Bill","30-Year Treasury Bill")))
ggplot(yield_curve_1,aes(x=date,y=value,color=duration))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~duration,ncol=2,scales="free")+theme_bw()+theme(legend.position="none",text = element_text(size=8))
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r,year_by_year basis,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
yield_curve_year<-yield_curve%>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(year(date)),month=as.numeric(month(date)))%>%
  arrange(year)%>%
  mutate(yearf=factor(year,levels=unique(year)))%>%
  mutate(maturity=factor(maturity,levels=c("3m","6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y")))

yield_curve_year_1999<-yield_curve_year%>%
  filter(year %in% c(1999:2021))

ggplot(yield_curve_year_1999,aes(x=maturity,y=value,color=year,group=month))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~yearf,ncol=4)+theme_bw()+theme(legend.position="none",text = element_text(size=7))
```
### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? 
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#According to research, the economy has taken anywhere from 12 months to 24 months to fall into recession when the yield curve inverts.Trace the beginning of the recession 12 months backward, we can draw the yield curve as below.

#Trace back to 2000-03-01, which is 12 months before the Mar 2001–Nov 2001 recession.
yield_curve_20000301<-yield_curve_year%>%
  filter(date=="2000-03-01")

ggplot(yield_curve_20000301,aes(x=maturity,y=value,group=year))+geom_line()+theme_bw()+labs(title="Yield curve on 2000-03-01")

#Trace back to 2006-12-01, which is 12 months before the Dec 2007–June 2009 recession.
yield_curve_20061201<-yield_curve_year%>%
  filter(date=="2006-12-01")

ggplot(yield_curve_20061201,aes(x=maturity,y=value,group=year))+geom_line()+theme_bw()+labs(title="Yield curve on 2006-12-01")

# The yield curves 12 months before the two recessions seem to flatten.
```
Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?
#When looking at the final graph, we noticed that for the timeframe used most recessions were preceded by a yield-curve inversion. Hence, we would argue that this observation can be interpreted as a leading indicator for an upcoming recession.
#Since 1999, short term yield exceeded long term yield in 2001,2007 and 2019.

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)
recessions
```


- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r}
#change the dataframe to long format, and express all figures in billions
tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = 'year', values_to = 'value') %>% 

  mutate(value=value/1e9)

#shorten the name of the indicators

tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Imports of goods and services"] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "General government final consumption expenditure"] <- "Government expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data[tidy_GDP_data == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"] <- "Household expenditure"

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
GDP_components_list <- c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")

#filter to the 3 countries and 5 indicators that we want to plot
tidy_GDP_data_1 <-tidy_GDP_data%>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% GDP_components_list)
```


```{r}
#change column name IndicatorName to Components of GDP
colnames(tidy_GDP_data_1)[3]<-"Components of GDP"

```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r}
#plot the graph
tidy_GDP_data_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value, group = `Components of GDP`, colour =`Components of GDP` ))+
  geom_line(size=0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title = 'GDP Components over time', subtitle = 'In constant 2010 GDP', y = 'Billion US$',x=NULL) +
  theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), aspect.ratio = 2)
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#change the dataframe to wide format and calculate net exports and proportion of GDP
tidy_GDP_data_2 <- tidy_GDP_data_1 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Components of GDP`,values_from=value) %>% 
  mutate(`Net Exports` = Exports-Imports) %>% 
  mutate(`Gross GDP Calculated` = `Government expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+`Household expenditure`+`Net Exports`) %>% 
  mutate(`Government Expenditure proportion` = `Government expenditure`/`Gross GDP Calculated`) %>% 
  mutate(`Gross capital formation proportion` = `Gross capital formation`/`Gross GDP Calculated`) %>% 
  mutate(`Household Expenditure proportion` = `Household expenditure`/`Gross GDP Calculated`) %>% 
  mutate(`Net exports proportion` = `Net Exports`/`Gross GDP Calculated`)

#change the dataframe to long format again and shows the proportion
tidy_GDP_data_3 <- tidy_GDP_data_2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 11:14, names_to = 'Components', values_to ="Percentage" )

#plot the second graph
tidy_GDP_data_3 %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=year, y=Percentage, group = Components, colour = Components))+
    geom_line(size=0.8) +
    facet_wrap(~Country) +
    scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=0.1)) +
    labs(title = 'GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars', y = 'porportion',x=NULL, caption = "Source:United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads") +
    theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size=10), aspect.ratio = 2)+
    theme(legend.title = element_blank())

```
> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r}
#Create the dataframe showing the GDP in the source table

country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
GDP_list <- c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports","Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")

tidy_GDP_data_4 <-tidy_GDP_data%>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% GDP_list)

#Calculate the GDP manually from components and then calculate the percetnage difference between the calucalted GDP and GDP shown in the orginial source

tidy_GDP_data_5 <- tidy_GDP_data_4 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `IndicatorName`,values_from=value) %>% 
  mutate(`Gross GDP Calculated` = `Government expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+`Household expenditure`+`Exports`-`Imports`) %>% 
  mutate(percent_diff = 
           (`Gross GDP Calculated`- `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)/`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)       

tidy_GDP_data_5[c(2,3,9,10,11)]


#The percentage difference is shown as percent_diff. For example, the percentage differnce for Germany is 1970 is 3.03%.
  
```

```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 
#The last chart shows that household expenidture accounts for most of the GDP in all three countries. The net exports take the least proportion in GDP among three countries. In India, the consumption proportion is decreasing over the decades while the investment proportion is increasing. It shows that investment opportunities in India have increased a lot over 2000-2010. The Germany has increasing proportion of net exports in 2000s, which shows Germany has become a more active exporter in the world market. The U.S. has decreasing government expenditure percentage, which maybe show that U.S. government is not spending as much as before.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
