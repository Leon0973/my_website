description: "My name is Leon Sharma, I am 23 years old and I am from the United Kingdom. 

I grew up in a culturally diverse home, my mother is Japanese and my father is half Indian and half English. This has given me a fantastic opportunity to be brought up exposed to a variety of *cultural ideologies* and *systems*.

I have always been an academic, but I have also always been very keen on sports. The sports which I am particularly interested in include:

+ Tennis
+ Football 
+ Swimming 

During my short academic career, I have studied Economics at Sheffield Hallam University (SHU). During my time at SHU, I was involved in many societies and clubs. I also had the chance to take an industrial placement year, in which I went abroad to Shanghai and spent 1 year working for a mid-market investment bank, rotating between several departments.

Now, in September 2021, I have embarked on a new Journey at **London Business School**, where I aim to learn and collaborate with the leading global business school in terms of international exposure and diversity. I look forward to the year ahead, where I can learn from the very best."
